# MERN 

This environment provides a proper, batteries-included setup for full stack MERN Development. Both Frontend and Backend support live updates, with `vite` and `nodemon` respectively. For Backend, it installs some sensible defaults, like `mongoose` as an ORM and `cors`.


To get started, simply run 

```
docker compose up --build
```


> Make sure no other containers or processes are using the required ports. 

#### Port Mapping

- Frontend : **5173**
- Backend : **3000**
- MongoDB : **27017**
